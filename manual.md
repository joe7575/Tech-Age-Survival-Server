# Fast Path to Tech Age Level 4 on the Tech Age Survival Server
by bob.strawn@gmail.com



First rule of gaming the game is to make friends and get along with others. If you don't, you are wasting your time and you will have half the fun. Finding a player you can trust to cooperate with will speed you through the game and share the enjoyment. The meta rules of playing games it that what you are doing or winning is short term. Friendships have a chance of lasting.

Second rule is to have fun. The advice below is how to maximize your speed of advancement. That can add to fun, but by itself it is potentially the death of fun. So the advice following is good to be aware of but not adhere to. Have fun first.



## First Steps

Here are your first priorities on the Tech Age Survival Server.

Study the rules and pass the exam.

Select "I" for inventory and near the bottom middle of the inventory screen is a green shirt between a globe with a red dot and some armor.
Select the green shirt and put your shirt and pants on so you don't look stupid.

Your steel pick should only be used sparingly or you will have a lot more work to do. Use it to dig a few stone and then make a stone pick and use it.
This is slower, but on this server iron is hard for a beginning character to make. You will need the steel pick if you find some diamond or mese so don't use it up until you can make iron.

Now you need to find a place to farm.
As you look, here are a few things you need to collect as you see them.

Jungle Grass: When you pick it, it might turn into cotton seeds. You will want cotton seeds.
Rock: You need to make a hoe and a chimney to make iron in.
Cactus: Good Fuel and best green dye source.
Flowers: You will need a bunch later so gather them now. In order of you will use a bunch of them, Blue, White, Red, Yellow. Leave a few in each location you gather in. You may need more and they will grow back if you do.
Dirt: You will need to make a garden and you will need to make at least one charcoal making kiln.
Tomato: Least work to the most nutritional value in the game. Live on Tomatoes if you want to be efficient. Carrots are good, potatoes are good but require cooking and fuel, wheat requires more work and fuel to make into bread. Lots of plants can feed you well, tomatoes are the least work. Blueberry bushes are also reasonably efficient since you only have to plant them once.

When you find a place to farm, type in the chat area, /sethome. Now you can return here by typing /home. You have another home setting in the inventory menu. The house icon with the red arrow sets your home. The house with the green arrow takes you there. Usually you will use the one in inventory to return to your mine, but it is good for exploring. A power gamer will set up his farm and home in a place he can reach easily and quickly from spawn since he can always return to spawn by typing /spawn. If you can return to your base quickly from spawn, then you can free up one of your home settings when you need it. This way you can have a home for exploring and a home for mining.
Garden soil needs water within three nodes. You can have water below your garden. This is efficient. The fastest way to make a garden is to hoe a shoreline.
Then you can make a pier of dirt over water. That will make an efficient garden. Three crops are all you need, cotton, wheat and tomato.
If you play at times when no one else is logged on, you want to make a bed so you can pass night. This speeds up your garden. If others are logged on when you usually play, pass on making a bed.

As you grow cotton you can make bags. you want four of the large bags. This will help you mine more, carry more and be prepared. A large bag takes 112 cotton to make so you will need to increase your garden as you get more seed. A Tech Age Mover (pusher) also requires cotton so you will end up wanting at least 200 extra cotton.
You will want to grow wheat since you will need to make starter blocks to make iron, steel and bronze.

While you are growing cotton, tomatoes, and wheat, you can harvest trees, make 24 chests and make a charcoal kiln. Since you start with a protection block, before you have iron to make a locked chest, just bury you chest near a protection block so it is hidden and hard to get into. You will need wood from both jungle trees and apple trees. Until you have steel or diamond, just do the harvest of wood and leaves by hand.

You can turn two leaves into a vine to use as a ladder to climb to the top of the tree right by the trunk. Then take all the leaves and tree trunk in layers as you go down. Turn leaves into oil for use as fuel or for making plastic. Replant the trees and make a tree farm in a convenient place. You will want several stacks of tree but you can do it all over time.

## Iron Age (TA1)

To make a charcoal kiln you will stack several layers of dirt, wood and a starter. If you make charcoal kilns side by side they can share a dirt wall and still function. In every case also take a look at the Tech Age construction board for advice and diagrams as well as this guide.

Layer One(Bottom):

```
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
```

Layer Two:

```
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
air     air     starter wood    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
```

*starter = lighter*

Layers Three and Four:

```
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
```

Layer Five

```
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
```

There is no hurry to light the kilns. You will need to get a flint from digging gravel and an iron ore to make a flint and steel to light the starter, but mining should wait until you have food, a good light source and bags to keep your ore in. When you are done, and you are ready to make charcoal, you can use a flint and steel to light the starter/lighter through the air hole and then quickly put a wood in front of the lit starter and then close up the air hole with dirt. After doing this layer two will now have this cross section:

```
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
dirt    wood    starter wood    dirt
dirt    wood    wood    wood    dirt
dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt    dirt
```

In a short while, the kiln should have smoke come out the top. When the smoke stops (aproximately 20 minutes), you can dig out the 9 charcoal and then put the wood and starter back in  it and make more charcoal. You want ten charcoal for a good burn, so you will probably want to make at least three batches of charcoal over time.


Once you have a few large bags and several stacks of food, it is time to start mining. Find a shared or public mine so you can go deep quick. You want to get below 600 so you can get mese. Later you will want to mine a 300 to get some stacks of baborium and bauxite. Snag at least a dozen or so baborium early on. To start with, you need diamond and mese early. Once you get three diamonds, let you steel pick wear out and make a diamond one. As you diamond pick gets close to wearing out save it in a bag and make another. You want about four stacks of iron ore, a dozen or so gold, a stack of tin, and a stack of copper. Go after all the mese and diamond you can, and save all the gravel and cobble you mine. It will double the value of your mining later.

Now that you have mined it is time to make a flint and steel. You can use it to light the starter in your charcoal kiln.

Use a furnace to process your copper, tin and gold ore. While that cooks, make a chimney to make iron, steel and bronze with. A few obsidian might be nice as well but only if you have burn time left and everything else is done.

Here is the floor plan for the chimney(blast furnace):

Layer One(Bottom):

```
cobble  cobble  cobble
cobble  cobble  cobble
cobble  cobble  cobble
```

Layer Two:

```
cobble  cobble  cobble
air     starter cobble
cobble  cobble  cobble
```

Layers Three to Twelve (Ten layers total):

```
cobble  cobble  cobble
cobble  char*   cobble
cobble  cobble  cobble
```

* *char is short for charcoal, and it can be dropped down the top of the tower to fill it after a starter is placed.*

Layer Thirteen:

```
air   air   air
air   air   air
air   air   air
```

Layer 14:

```
air   air   air
air   pot*  air
air   air   air
```

* *pot is short for the TA1 Melting Pot (techage:meltingpot)*

As you build the chimney put ivy on a side of it so you can climb it easily. One it is finished you need to put one stack of coal and three stacks of iron ore in the melting pot to make steel with and light the starter at the bottom. You can do other tasks, but keep a watch on the iron and as it goes down add another stack of iron so it will make iron. Right as the iron runs out add copper and tin to make bronze with at least 15 copper and 5 tin will make enough for your first burn. You will want to save some tin for other tasks though.

## Steam Age (TA2)

After making iron, steel and bronze, you can make your first machine setup. Here is the basic line to set up.
Ta2 firebox with a ta2 boiler base on that and a ta2 boiler top on top. It is possible to do it with one but the classic configuration need 6 ta2 steam pipes. you will need one more steam pipe to make the boiler top and one to make the cylinder. You can make it work with one set of 3 steam pipes but 3 sets would be needed typically. The boiler set takes five bronze to make and each set of three steam pipes require 2 bronze. Unless you are being really tight with resources this means you should make at least 16 bronze.

After setting up the boiler, put ten water in the tank run a steam pipe from the top of the tank to the TA2 cylinder and put the TA2 flywheel next to the cylinder. Now you can run a line of drive axles and gear boxes. You will need a gear box for each machine.

With your 24 chests you can make eight TA4 protected chests. This gives you a jump towards further advancement and theTA4 chests hold more. Use three of them to store and sort your junk so you have room in your inventory to work and collect things.

Make six TA2 pushers, a TA2 grinder, a TA2 gravel sieve, A TA2 distributor, A TA2 gravel rinser and A hopper.

Here is your layout left to right: chest for input cobble, pusher to move cobble to the grinder, grinder, pusher to move gravel from the grinder to the return chest, return chest for gravel that was not sieved to return to,  pusher to move gravel from the return chest to the gravel sieve, gravel sieve, pusher to move the output from the gravel sieve to the distributor, distributor.  The grinder sieve and distribute will all need a gear box under it and a line of drive axles connecting the gear boxes to each other and the flywheel.

Continuing from the distributor, it does not need pushers. It sort of is one. Run a line of techage tube to from the back of the distributor back to the return chest. put a chest at the front of the distributor.
Now put cobble in the chest for input cobble. turn on the pusher by hitting it once so it moves cobble to the grinder. Now you need to put coal in the firebox, wait for the temp to rise up and then you can turn on the flywheel and go down the line activating it and making sure it is all processing. When the distributor starts filling up, you can direct all but the two gravels to go to the front chest. Some of the gravel will not be processed so you want it to return to the return chest so it goes back through the sieve. The sieved gravel will be sent further down the line after you have set up the gravel rinser.

To set up the gravel rinser consult the diagram on the Techage Construction Board

Here is a bottom up layered description of the three main rows to help sort out some possible issues.
Apart from five glass on each side to keep the water from flowing off the line, the tube from the distributor to the return chest and the chest in front of the distributor, everything is on a single line.

Layer One (bottom):
firebox - air - steam pipe - cylinder - flywheel - axle - gearbox - axle - axle - axle - gearbox - axle - gearbox -axle -gearbox

Layer Two:

boiler bottom - air - steam pipe - air - chest - pusher - grinder - pusher - chest - pusher - sieve - pusher - distributor - tube - axle - tube - pusher -chest

Layer Three:

boiler top -air - steam pipe - air - air - air - air - air - air - air - air - glass  - tube - rinser -tube - hopper to following chest - chest

Layer four:

steam pipe - steam pipe - steam pipe - air - air - air - air - air - air - air - air - glass - water source - air (flowing water) - air (flowing water) -air (flowing water) - air (flowing water) - air (flowing water) - glass.

This machine line will turn gravel into sand while also making resources you will need to get to the next level. Put a TA2 Electronic Fabricator in front of a gearbox and you can produce the vacuum tubes that are the bottleneck that keeps you from the next level of technology.



## Oil Age (TA3)

Now you need to make electrical power. This requires a bit of a 3d twist to describe the best way to do this but the plan in the Tech Age Construction board shows you the directions the pipes must connect to and from. Once you get it built, fill it with water and start it running. Then you can start converting things to run on electricity.
TA electric junction boxes will go where the gearboxes were and electric cable will replace the axles. With a few more electric cables to connect the power to the new generator you will be wired to convert. You will need iron, mese and vacuum tubes for this. Now that you have power you can make the jump straight to TA4.



## Future Age (TA4)

Make a TA4 Heater and put it on a connected electric junction box. Then put a TA3 Furnace Top on the TA4 Heater. You no longer need charcoal or the chimneys to make steel with. You can cook it all in the furnace.

Now upgrade your TA2 Electronic Fabricator to TA3 so you can make WLan Chips and if you have baborium you can start upgrading everything to TA4. Don't upgrade your TA3 Electronic Fabricator to TA4. Make a new one since a TA4 does not make what the TA3 makes and you will need both.
If you don’t have baborium to upgrade the rest of your equipment to TA4, it is time to start mining at -300 so you can make other things.

Congratulations, you have made your way to the point where you can make the most of technology. There are a lot of other things you are not yet equipped to do, but you now have a solid foundation to work from. You can process ore efficiently, smelt and start thinking about going solar. You have bypassed the drilling for oil stage, but you may want to drill oil and process it to make resin for making wind power. You may want to make aluminum but that is another complex system all on it’s own. Good luck and enjoy!


To go solar, you need to find a hot place. You would think the desert was best but you would be wrong. So far the wet Jungles are the best.
Make a wrench, the tech age info tool one, so you can explore areas and get data on them. Warmer is better for solar.
To obtain oil you need to find it. So make a TA3 oil explorer. This will need a baborium so if you have one you are in great form, but if you don’t you will need to go to -300 and dig. You might as well collect bauxite so you can make aluminum later. No need to go crazy 3 stacks each of bauxite and baborium will do for a good start.



*Many thanks to Bob for this great "fast path"*
